# Pokemon Rock Paper Scissors
(Fire, Water, Grass)
 
 ## How to Play
You and a friend (on another device or browser) will choose between 1st or 2nd generation pokemon to play rock paper scissors with.

The game starts when both sides have been selected.

Fire beats grass, grass beats water, water beats fire.

No keyboard controls, sorry!
